# California-Business-Analysis
Used R to analyze a data set of 500,000 California business that received loans of $150,000 or less from the Paycheck Protection Program as part of the CARES Act in March 2020.

    1) Calculated the average amount of jobs retained and loan amount from a sample and created confidence intervals for the means.
    2) Conducted pairwise hypothesis testing to compare the jobs retained and loan amounts for businesses.
    3) Fit the sample data and applied linear regression to develop an understanding for the population data.
